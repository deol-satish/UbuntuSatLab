To switch to the kernel version `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91` on your Ubuntu system, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Reboot your system:**
   First, reboot your system and choose the kernel version `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91` from the boot menu.

   - Reboot your machine.
   - During the boot process, hold down the **Shift** key to bring up the GRUB menu (if it doesnâ€™t appear automatically).
   - From the GRUB menu, select **Advanced options for Ubuntu**.
   - Choose the kernel version `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91` and press Enter.

### 2. **Set the default kernel (optional)**:
   If you want to make `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91` your default kernel, you can update GRUB settings:

   1. **Edit GRUB**:
      Run the following command to open the GRUB configuration file:
      ```bash
      sudo nano /etc/default/grub
      ```

   2. **Modify GRUB settings**:
      Look for the line `GRUB_DEFAULT=0`. This refers to the default boot entry. To set the default kernel, you can set this to the appropriate entry number or use the exact kernel name. 
   
      For example, if you know the exact kernel version, you can set it like this:
      ```bash
      GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91"
      ```

   3. **Update GRUB**:

      ```

   4. **Reboot**:
      Finally, reboot the system:
      ```bash
      sudo reboot
      ```

After rebooting, your system should start with the kernel `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91` by default. You can confirm this by running:
```bash
uname -r
```
It should display `5.15.72-56eae305c-prague-91`.
